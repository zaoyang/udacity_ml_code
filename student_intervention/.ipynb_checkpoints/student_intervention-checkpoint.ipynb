In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: \n",
    "Three learning models are: Support Vector Machines, Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machine is a learner that you can use and it's appropriate for classification. It's appropriate in real life applications in a variety of instances including text classification (Inductive Learning Algorithms and Representations for Text Categorization, S. Dumais, J. Platt, D. Heckerman, M. Sahami,  7th International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,  1998.), digit recognition (Y. Le Cun, L.D. Jackel, etc.\n",
    "In J.H. Kwon and S. Cho, editors, Neural Networks: The Statistical Mechanics Perspective, pages, Discovering informative patterns and data cleaning.), customer segmentation (On Support Vector Decision Trees for Database Marketing K.P. Bennett, D. Wu, and L. Auslender Report No. 98-100, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, 1998.). The common uses are when there is a low amount of data (i.e. under 100k rows). Its advantages are that it's effective in high dimensional spaces, memory efficient because it only uses the support vectors (vectors that are close to the margin that you're optimizing), and still effective where the # of features are greater than the sample. Its disadvantages are that it's dis advantages are that if the features are much greater >>>> than the # of samples, it does not perform well. It's also sensitive to noise as a small amount of mis classified labels will allow it to not perform well. Choice of kernel and parameters are key to understand. The reason why I think this is a candidate is that it's a small data set (under 100k rows), features are not dramatically above the sample size, and the decision boundary should be linear at least from initial glance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nearest Neighbors is a non paramterized learner and learns from retaining the instances and allows you to compute the nearest points to the X value that you want to compute. This is practical for regression and classification problems, and you want to use it in handwritten digits recognition, satellite image scenes, real estate to predict price. It also performs well for irregular boundaries as there isn't a boundary or margin that it's trying to recognize. It's also robust to noisy training data and effective if the training data is large. The disadvantages are the computation is quite high as the query runs through all the training examples. Certain trees can minimize this. When tuning it's not clear what K to use nor what the distance function is, and tuning it can be a pain. It's appropriate because it's a small data set if the decision boundaries are irregular it can provide better performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is an ensemble learning mehtod and is good for low amounts of data. The applications can be across Diabestic Retinopahty (Application of Random Forests Methods to Diabetic Retinopathy Classification Analyses), micro array data, and remote sensing (Random forest in remote sensing: A review of applications and future directions). The advantages is that it doesn't expect linear features or features that interact linearly. It also handles high dimensional spaces and a large amount of training examples very well. Random Forest relative to other trees such as Gradient Boosted Decision Trees work well out of the box. Other trees have a number of hyper parameters that you have to train. An example of a hyperparameter is the # of nodes, of depth of the tree that inherently encompass the complexity of a given tree. The normal decision tree tends to over fit and random forest, which is an ensemble of other trees tend not to over fit. Random Forest seems to be a very good out of the box machine learning algorithm, which is better than naive bayes as it tends to have more accuracy than Logistic Regression. I think it's applicable to this data because it works well out of the box, can expect a number of different type of features (non linear and linear), and can handle high dimensional data well (this data set isn't high dimensional relatively speaking, so it would work). \n",

    "**Answer: This best algorithm used is a nearest neighbor algorithm. It computes the closest data points to the data point that you're looking for. Intuitively, think about your house, condo, or apartment that you live in. If you were to use a way of approximating the price, you would use a similar house that's close to you that has the same number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and sq footage. Then you can use that as a comp to check the price and estimate your current price. That's how nearest neighbor works, which is choosing the K best closest points to use. In this case, we use the different features: age, sex, parental situation to choose to use. The nearest neighbor uses the closest attributes for example, students that have minimal absences with a family size and certain parents will predict pass. In our case, we use 30 different features to compare the student we want to predict to the data already in our data set. To predict whether the student will pass. They'll compare the 30 different features with the existing set and use a distance measure very similar to the real estate example, which is approximating the shortest distance between the student and the students in the data points. This is similar to comparing a X, Y coordinate to a other X,Y coordinates in a X,Y plane. In that case you use pythagoras theorem, but in this case you use a similar Eucledian distance or other measurement to compare and choose the lowest distance.   **"
